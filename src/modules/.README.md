# Folder: `src/modules`

This folder is for `Modules/Features` of our app, we can treat this as containers. Each module/feature will have all its related files (e.g., `.js/.jsx/.sass`) in a single folder. We may have some module-related components which we will be placing inside `<feature_name>/frames` folder to indicate it is a structural component. 

**Note:**

Components used in more than one module will be kept in `src/library/common/components` folder.
